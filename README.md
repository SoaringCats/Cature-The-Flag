War
===

War is SoaringCat's sort-of-mimic of Team Fortress Two.

-------------

## Requirements ##

War requires <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/tag">TagAPI</a> by <a href="https://github.com/mbax/">mbaxter</a>. It additionally requires the latest version of <a href="http://bukkit.org">CraftBukkit</a> which is available for download <a href="http://dl.bukkit.org">here</a>.

## Works with ##

The plugin is currently coded and _hopefully tested_ to work with CraftBukkit version 1.4.7-R0.1 and TagAPI version 1.9.3.
